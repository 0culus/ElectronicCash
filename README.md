# ElectronicCash
Some C# tinkering with Schneier's `Applied Cryptography`. This is an attempt at implementing Secure Cash Protocol 4. It's kind of a lame protocol since it requires a central authority (The Bank) but it's a nice implementation exercise. 

This is just an attempt to apply some actual software engineering to a project I did for a class previously. ~~The modeling 
project requires Visual Studio Ultimate.~~ The modeling project has been removed in favor of the new Code Map stuff, which is nicer to use. You need Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise for this. 

This code is NOT intended to be for production; it is not secure and misteaks guaronted.
